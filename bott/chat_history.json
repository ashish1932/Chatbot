        "content": " Goa, located on the western coast of India, is known for its tropical climate with two main seasons: monsoon and dry. The dry season lasts from November to March, and it is characterized by warm and sunny weather, making it the peak tourist season. The average temperature during this period ranges from 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) to 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F).\n\nThe monsoon season, on the other hand, lasts from June to October. During this period, Goa receives heavy rainfall, and the average temperature ranges from 26\u00b0C (79\u00b0F) to 31\u00b0C (88\u00b0F). The monsoon season brings lush greenery to the region, but it may not be the best time for beach activities due to the frequent rainfall.\n\nIt's important to note that Goa's weather can be quite variable, even within a single day, especially during the monsoon season. So, it's always a good idea to check the weather forecast before planning your activities."

        "content": " I cannot provide an exact answer to that question as the cutoff scores for admission into a B.Tech IT (Bachelor of Technology in Information Technology) program can vary greatly depending on the specific university or college, its location, and other factors such as the number of applicants and seats available.\n\nCutoff scores are typically based on previous years' data, and they can be influenced by several factors, including the difficulty level of the entrance exam, the number of applicants, and the availability of seats. Some universities may also consider other factors such as class XII grades, work experience, or extracurricular activities during the admission process.\n\nIt's important to note that cutoff scores can also change from year to year, and they may be different for different branches or specializations within the same university.\n\nTherefore, to get a more accurate answer, I would recommend checking with the specific university or college you are interested in for their current or expected cutoff scores for the B.Tech IT program in 2024. You can usually find this information on their website or by contacting their admission office directly."
